                localStorage and sessionStorage are relatively new APIs (meaning, not all legacy browsers will support them) and are near identical (both in APIs and capabilities) with the sole exception of persistence. sessionStorage (as the name suggests) is only available for the duration of the browser session (and is deleted when the tab or window is closed) - it does, however, survive page reloads .
                
                Clearly, if the data you are storing needs to be available on an ongoing basis then localStorage is preferable to sessionStorage - although you should note both can be cleared by the user so you should not rely on the continuing existence of data in either case.
                
                localStorage and sessionStorage are perfect for persisting non-sensitive data needed within client scripts between pages (for example: preferences, scores in games). The data stored in localStorage and sessionStorage can easily be read or changed from within the client/browser so should not be relied upon for storage of sensitive or security-related data within applications..</p>

Block scoped variables: A block scoped variable means that the variable defined within a block will not be accessible from outside the block.A scope is where you can refer to a variable. a block defines a block scope a variable defined inside a block will be defined only inside that block and you can't reference it after the end of block.<br><br>1.

The scope of a local-variable declaration is from the point at which the declaration appears to the end of that block.<br><br>3.The scope of a local-variable declaration that appears in the initialization section of a for statement’s header is the body of the for statement and the other expressions in the header.<br><br>4. A method or field’s scope is the entire body of the class. This enables non-static methods of a class to use the fields and other methods of the class.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">JavaScript event loop :</h5>
              <p class="card-text">The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.<br><br>Concepts, like passing callbacks to functions or writing asynchronous code, are often not so difficult to implement, which makes most JavaScript developers care less about what goes on under the hood. They just don’t care about understanding the complexities that have deeply abstracted from them by the language.

                As a JavaScript developer, it becomes increasingly important to understand what really happens under the hood and how most of these complexities abstracted from us really work. It helps us make more informed decisions, which can, in turn, boost our code performance drastically.
                
                This article focuses on one of the very important but seldom understood concepts or terms in JavaScript. The EVENT LOOP!. 
                
                Writing asynchronous code can not be avoided in JavaScript, but why does a code running asynchronously really mean? i.e. The Event Loop
                
                Before we can understand how the event loop works, we first have to understand what JavaScript itself is and how it works!</p>

            <div class="card-body">
              <h5 class="card-title">Undefined type :</h5>
              <p class="card-text">The undefined type is a primitive type that has only one value undefined . By default, when a variable is declared but not initialized, it is assigned the value of undefined . In this example, the counter is a variable. Since counter hasn't been initialized, it is assigned the value undefined <br><br>undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope. The initial value of undefined is the primitive value undefined.

                In all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a non-configurable, non-writable property. (Even when this is not the case, avoid overriding it.)
                
                A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned</p>
